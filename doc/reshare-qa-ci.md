# ReShare QA Environments

QA and shared testing are performed on a shared reshare install
known as the "Cardinal Consortium" comprising three pairs of ReShare tenants. 
Each pair of tenants is capable of running different versions of the ReShare
software. All tenants are able to borrow and lend to one another.
